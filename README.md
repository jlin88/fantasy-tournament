# Fantasy Tournament

This game is a one-user-two-player game, so one user should be able to play setup fighters for both teams. For simplicity, we will call the order of fighters in each team “lineup”, like a batting order in baseball or softball.

During the tournament, the game will output the information about each battle in the tournament. After the tournament is finished, the game should display the final score for each team, and then, depending on the final score, display the winner of the tournament, or a tie
