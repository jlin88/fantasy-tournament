** Description:   This is the header file for a menu function
 *                to test the Character class and derived characters.
 *                The menu first asks the user if they want to play.
 *                Then has the user select each of the characters
 *                for the two players. The characters will be
 *                dynamically allocated and will battle each other
 *                until one player wins. The menu will then ask the
 *                user if they want to play again.
